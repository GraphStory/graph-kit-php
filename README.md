# Graph Kit for PHP

## Graph Databases

Graph databases are amazing. They have no peer when it comes to dealing with
connected data. Their speed, ease-of-use, and utility make them a truly
disruptive technology.

That's all well and good, but how to get started with graphs? What is graph
data, and what are graph databases? What are the practical applications of graph 
databases, and where in the world can one find the time to learn, implement,
and integrate this new technology?

## Graph Story to the Rescue

The Graph Kit for PHP is a demo app provided by [Graph Story](http://graphstory.com) 
to jump start your learning, understanding, and implementation of graphs and
graph databases. You'll learn about Neo4j and nodes and relationships and Cypher (the
declarative Neo4J query language) and Neo4j's REST API, and how to interact with 
it all programmatically. Best of all, your learning will be all hands on! 

## Graph Database and Graph Kit Data

The Graph Kit data, and a hosted instance of Neo4j, is available with a 
[free trial](http://graphstory.com/phpfree) account on the Graph Story
platform. What are you waiting for? Create your [free trial account](http://graphstory.com/phpfree)
